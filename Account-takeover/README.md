How I Was Able To Takeover Any Virustotal Account
Hi Everyone,

Iâ€™m back with one of my recent findings. Well, As you guys already know that Google is a huge MNC and itâ€™s security is tough as Hell. So, technically itâ€™s hard to find something like a â€˜security flawâ€™.

Honestly, it was my dream to get my name on the â€˜Google Hall Of Fameâ€™. I saw some leets are already there and they have their names published in news. So, I started with a subdomain enumeration using sublist3r. I got many subdomains, also searched about Google Subdomains online.

You may be aware about a subdomain name Virustotal.com.

As, I was going through the major subdomains and thought to pay virustotal.com a visit. I quickly opened virustotal.com and went through all the features and noted em one by one. I was in search of some low hanging fruits, but got nothing out of it. I was little disappointed by that so I took a break. When I resumed precisely after few hours, to my surprise I forgot my account passwordâ€¦ -/

I visited the â€˜forgot passwordâ€™ page and keyed in my details and recived an e-mail. I copied that â€˜password resetâ€™ link and opned in new tab and intercepted that request.

Everything went as usual with nothing worth special attention, but then I noticed something in the request . I captured this request and sent it to the repeater.
I visited the â€˜forgot passwordâ€™ page again, but this time I entered my second account details. I received the â€˜password resetâ€™ link.
Then, I did the same as i did with my first account,

I replaced my second account username with my first account username.

And, I forwarded the request.
Then I chose a new password and entered it twice as required. After that I tried to login to my first account nothumanninja.

But it said â€˜wrong passwordâ€™

Oops! ðŸ˜Ž

Then I tried the new passwordâ€¦
BOOOOM!!!
